# Tender Bloom Care Work

This is a HTML/CSS/JS website for my good friend's personal business. I also created the illustrations, custom fonts and branding.
Tender Bloom Care Work provides peer support care sessions by phone, video, or in-person, offering a compassionate, collaborative space for emotional processing.
I used Cursor AI to write this README for git.
